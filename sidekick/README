a LangGraph-based AI workflow where multiple agents collaborate.

Hereâ€™s the flow:
ðŸ”¹ A Research Agent: investigates outage causes and proposes resilient architecture designs.
ðŸ”¹ An Evaluator: checks whether each answer meets the defined success criteria.
ðŸ”¹ LangGraphâ€™s conditional edges dynamically control the process:
â€ƒâ€¢ If the evaluator approves â†’ the system finalizes the design.
â€ƒâ€¢ If not â†’ it either requests further data or clarification from the user or use other provided helping tools, 
	then reruns the analysis until the design meets the standards.
