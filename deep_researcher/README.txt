Hereâ€™s how you can approach this project:

Objective: main goal is to create a research agent that can ask clarifying questions about the task at hand. This enables the agent to better tailor its searches based on user queries.

First Steps: Starting by developing a feature where the agent asks three clarifying questions related to the user's research query. This initial interaction will help gather specific information needed before conducting a search.

Implementation: Utilizing the OpenAI Agents SDK to build the functionality of an agent. eventually incorporating its ability to search for information and summarize findings effectively.

Testing and Iteration: After developing the research agent, you should test it with various research prompts to evaluate how well it distills information and whether it can effectively refine its search based on the answers to its clarifying questions.

Commercial Value: This project mimics the work of a junior analyst, gathering and summarizing data as a human would. Understanding this can help you articulate its business value effectively.
