The project involves a "crew" of various agents that work collaboratively, utilizing tools like FastAPI and MCP to autonomously gather and analyze market data, manage investment strategies, and execute trades.
These agents are programmed to conduct research, update their investment strategies, and operate within a trading simulation engine that runs on code developed by the team.
The collaborative effort highlights the integration of AI in enhancing trading strategies, showcasing both the technical capabilities of the agents.
